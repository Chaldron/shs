<!-- Netlify Form Templates -->
<!-- Netlify uses bots to setup form end points on their servers by scraping the site's HTML. Because we are building a Vue SPA,
  HTML is not stored in the HTML files but rather injected by JS scripts. Therefore, we need to upload a raw HTML form "skeleton"
  for every single form used on the site. These skeletons must include the <form> element, along with a hidden input wit the form's name.
-->
<form name="document-request" method="POST" netlify data-netlify="true" hidden>
  <input type="hidden" name="form-name" value="document-request" />
  <input
    type="text"
    name="class-name"
    placeholder="Underwater Basket Weaving Accelerated"
    required

  <input
    type="text"
    name="document-name"
    placeholder="Pine Needle Basketry: From Forest Floor to Finished Project"

  <input
